# Fast and Accurate Prediction of Tautomer Ratios in Aqueous Solutions via Siamese Network

<p align="justify">
Tautomerization plays a critical role in numerous chemical and biological processes, impacting factors such as molecular stability, reactivity, biological activity, and ADME-Tox properties. Many drug-like molecules exist in multiple tautomeric states in aqueous solutions and complicating drug discovery. Predicting these tautomeric ratios and identifying the predominant species rapidly and accurately is crucial for computational drug discovery. In this study, we introduce sPhysNet-Taut, a deep learning model fine-tuned with experimental data leveraging the Siamese network, built upon a pre-trained model. This model predicts tautomer ratios in aqueous solutions using MMFF94-optimized geometries directly. We demonstrate how to correct the limitation of the pre-trained model for predicting molecular internal energies and solvent effects by fine-tuning using experimental data. On an experimental test set, sPhysNet-Taut surpasses all other methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an RMSE of 1.9 kcal/mol on the 100-tautomer set and an RMSE of 1.0 kcal/mol on the SAMPL2 challenge, and providing the best ranking power for tautomer pairs. This work not only provides a useful deep learning model for predicting tautomer ratios, but also provides a protocol for modeling pairwise data. To facilitate user-friendliness, we developed a readily accessible tool to predict stable tautomeric states in aqueous solutions, enumerating all possible tautomeric states and ranking them using the sPhysNet-Taut model.

## Notes

The limitation of our model is that the performance may decrease with increasing molecular size. Since the maximum number of heavy atoms in our DFT-calculated dataset is only **20**, the model may not perform well with larger molecules.
